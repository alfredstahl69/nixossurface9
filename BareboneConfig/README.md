Hey there again. This here is the Barebone config. I recommend checking over it yourself, especially if changing the OFFSET to fit your System.
Also you may obviously always change anything in there as much as you want to, you can for example simply change the name of grub here. Though keep in mind that you'll also need to apply the changes here to the actual configuration that you'll use at the end. This here isnt meant as a solution, afterall its only temporary.
My reason for that was that building the actual system takes like hours and hours so this is quite a bit quicker.
Right keep in mind that this here has my name and a german layout. You may need to change that, just ask chatgpt how.
Right also an issue with later on building will be that it will get very very hot. I recommend simply putting the surface on battery save mode, then it will take longer but wont overheat.
While building mine I didnt have it on battery save and also plugged in and it got so hot that it just simply froze. interestingly enough it didnt shut down but everything just closed intself.. right when it was all building.. great. though simply restarting the switch command seems to work.. so I guess it isnt that big of an issue? 
Anyway, yeah I guess thats about it from me here. Good luck haha
